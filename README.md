# CRICKET-T20-WORLD-CUP USING POWERBI
A comprehensive project aimed at selecting the best 11 players for a cricket team using T20 World Cup data.

**Problem Statement** : The primary objective is to identify and select the optimal team of 11 cricket players based on performance metrics from T20 World Cup data.

**Steps Taken in the Analysis** :

Data Processing : Utilizing Python and Pandas, the scraped data was cleaned and structured for analysis.
Data Analysis: Key performance indicators such as batting average, strike rate, consistency etc. were analyzed to assess player performance.
Data Visualization: Power BI was employed to visualize the data, aiding in the interpretation of results.
Team Selection: Based on the analysis, the top 11 players were selected to form the optimal team.

**Key Takeaways** :
The focus is on selecting players who can contribute in key moments and help win the game.

Selection of Openers:

Jos Buttler is chosen as the wicketkeeper-batter for the opening position due to his consistency, high batting average, and solid strike rate.
Rilee Rossouw is selected as the second opener due to his strong strike rate and ability to score quickly.
Alex Hales is kept as a reserve opener.

Anchor Selection:

Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav are selected as key anchor players. Kohli is chosen for his consistent run-scoring ability, while Yadav is picked for his exceptional strike rate and ability to accelerate the score.
Selection of Number 5: Glenn Phillips is selected for the number 5 position due to his high strike rate and solid batting average.

Bowler Selection:

Three fast bowlers are chosen: Sam Curran, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Anrich Nortje. These players have strong bowling averages and strike rates, making them key assets for taking wickets and controlling the economy.
It is important to have a solid bowling attack, especially in the powerplay.

All-rounders:

Sikandar Raza is chosen as an all-rounder for his high strike rate and consistency.
Shadab Khan is selected as the second all-rounder due to his strong performance in both batting and bowling.

Batting All-rounder Decision: The focus was on selecting an all-rounder who can contribute both with the bat and ball. I ultimately lean towards Marcus Stoinis for his batting strength and strike rate, over other options like Ben Stokes and Glenn Maxwell.

Final 11 Selection:

The final 11 includes players like Jos Buttler, Rilee Rossouw, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Glenn Phillips, Sikandar Raza, Shadab Khan, and fast bowlers like Sam Curran, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Anrich Nortje.
The team is designed to have strong batting depth with players who can score quickly, along with a potent bowling attack to contain the opposition.
